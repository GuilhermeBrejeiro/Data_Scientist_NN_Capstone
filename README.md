## Python and it's packs
To run the Jupyter notebooks and python scripts, you will need a standard installtion of Anaconda with Python 3.6.x

**Additional libraries:**
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn
* warnings
* imblearn

## Project Motivation
This project is part of the capstone requirement for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree, a real life problem wich the goal was to characterize what types of individuals are more likely to be customers of a mail-order retailer and predict which customers would respond positively to marketing campaigns.

## Overview
The goal of this project was to apply unsupervised learning to identify the groups of people  who are likely become a customer. The second step was to apply supervised learning to predict the probability of a person to become customer.
To accomplish these goals, I applied the following steps:
* Preprocess the data, including feature scaling and PCA.
* Apply KMeans clustering to segment the population into clusters.
* Apply supervised learning to predict whether a person is likely to become a customer.
* To evaluate the model, using auc and f1 score as the evaluation metric.

## File Description
* All coding is done in detailed steps in the jupyter notebook
* The data used for this project is not publically available. Hence, no data is provided in this public Github repository.
